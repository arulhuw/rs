Future of education Universities

'We shouldn't go back to lectures': why future students will learn online.

Universities moved online in response to coronavirus, but experts predict some changes will outlast the pandemic.

University in September will likely include videos and readings that students can do in their own time. 
In the early medieval universities of Europe, masters stood at the front of a hall, reading excerpts from texts and commenting on them, while students copied down notes word for word. If that sounds familiar, it’s because it is. Today’s universities bear remarkable similarities to their antecedents.
This deeply culturally ingrained model has been shaken up by the coronavirus pandemic, which has prevented students from entering lecture theatres in the UK since late March. Universities have been forced to shift online, and while lots of students are unhappy with the speed and quality of the changes, many experts believe that online learning is key to the future of higher education.
“That it was ever a great idea for one person to stand in lecture hall and transmit to 200-300 people and to expect them to receive and accept that information in one go was clearly ridiculous,” says Ian Dunn, the Coventry University provost who spearheaded the university’s new online-only degrees. “I’ve already said to my university that we shouldn’t go back to lectures.”
Although universities have slowly been moving aspects of their curriculums online for years, Dunn thinks they have fallen behind on where their students want them to be – and that the coronavirus crisis has granted them a valuable opportunity to catch up.

Online learning in higher education: exploring advantages and disadvantages for engagement

Abstract
As the popularity of online education continues to rise, many colleges and universities are interested in how to best deliver course content for online learners. This study explores the ways in which taking courses through an online medium impacts student engagement, utilizing data from the National Survey of Student Engagement. Data was analyzed using a series of ordinary least squares regression models, also controlling for relevant student and institutional characteristics. The results indicated numerous significant relationships between taking online courses and student engagement for both first-year students and seniors. Those students taking greater numbers of online courses were more likely to engage in quantitative reasoning. However, they were less likely to engage in collaborative learning, student-faculty interactions, and discussions with diverse others, compared to their more traditional classroom counterparts. The students with greater numbers of online courses also reported less exposure to effective teaching practices and lower quality of interactions. The relationship between these engagement indicators and the percentage of classes taken online suggests that an online environment might benefit certain types of engagement, but may also be somewhat of a deterrent to others. Institutions should consider these findings when designing online course content, and encourage faculty to contemplate ways of encouraging student engagement across a variety of delivery types.

Benefits of Online Learning – 16 Advantages to Learning Online
Online learning is a popular alternative to traditional on-campus, in-person learning. In 2019, Research and Markets forecasted that the online education market will reach $230 billion by 2025—and given the major impact of COVID-19, it’s likely that online programs will see even greater growth. 
In fact, the pandemic has demonstrated what a practical, sustainable model online learning is. It keeps education accessible during a public health crisis, natural disaster, or other circumstance where students and faculty can’t travel. It can serve students across a wider geographic range, bringing in voices from across the country—and beyond. The online learning environment also promotes a better work-life balance. In this post, we outline the advantages of online learning and how you can leverage them to foster your personal and professional development.
Advantages of Online Learning
The format of online courses can help you thrive both personally and academically, helping you meet your goals.
1. You don’t need to relocate
With online classes, you don’t need to move to a different city or commute long distances in order to attend the program of your choice. You can stay where you are and keep your current job while you work toward enhancing your career with an online college or graduate degree (However, some programs require fieldwork experience, which may necessitate relocation.) 
On the other hand, if you want to become a digital nomad—someone who embraces a location-independent, technology-enabled lifestyle—online education may allow you to do that too. You can watch lectures and complete your coursework wherever you are—whether that’s at home, in a café, or on an exotic beach.
