## What is an academic source?


- An academic source is one which has been peer reviewed (checked by experts before publication).

- An academic source often refers to research and may have in-text citations and a reference list. 

- Examples of academic sources include:
  - Books
  - Journal articles


## Is a reliable source the same as an academic source?

- Academic sources are reliable, but not all reliable sources are academic.

- Many sources have not been peer reviewed and so are not considered to be academic, such as:

- Reputable news broadcasters such as: BBC

- Broadsheet newspapers (The Guardian, The Times, The Independent)

- Quality Magazines (New Scientist, News Week, The Economist) 

- Trade Publications and Company Website
    - Reports
    - Websites



At this level of your studies, you can still use these sources, however, as you progress, you should rely on them less and less.

- ##### The main characteristics of academic style include:

1. No personal language e.g. ‘we’ ‘you’
- ‘This article will examine …..’ NOT ‘We will examine’ 
2. No idioms 
- ‘There are two main advantages and disadvantages’ NOT ‘Every coin has two sides.’
3. No contractions
- ‘Do not use contractions.’ NOT ‘Don’t use contractions’
4. Use of cautious language.
- ‘Use of academic language is likely to indicate an academic source.’ NOT 
- ‘Use of academic language indicates an academic source.’
