## Suggested points to cover in your justification

1. The Search Process 
- What were the key words you used in your search? 
- What search platform did you use (e.g. digital library)?
- How did you select your source from the list that came up?

2. The Evaluation of the source
- When was the source published? What effect does that have on the reliability of the information?
- Does the source relate to the question you are trying to answer? What is the intended audience of the source?
- Who is the author and what are their credentials? Are they qualified to write about the subject?
- Is the information in the source supported by evidence? Has the source been reviewed?
- Is the language used formal or academic? What is the purpose of the source?


3. The use of the source
- How would you use this source to answer your question? (Which part of the essay will it help you to write?)
